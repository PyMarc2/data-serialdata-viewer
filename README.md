# data-serialdata-viewer
This is a widget I made from scratch in order to see my project's data in a more fun way.
It serves mainly the purpose of displaying data. That is all.

### What it does, how to do it (quick version)
- reads from the serial ports of your device and looks for a serial connection.
- Once it has established connection, the data is shown in the "terminal".
- The gray area is a drawing surface. Double click pops rectangles.
- Shapes represent your sensors from which the data may come.
- Right-click and enter a 're' equation that will parse through your serial data to look for the specific value you want.
- BAM. get blown away. The value is updating on the graphical sensor.
- You can put names and colormap to each individual sensor.
